# PyAsm
- PyAsm: It is to run `python` code using `interpreter`, not so interesting but, the `interpreter` is written in assembly.

# Guide to make it work
- `$ ./fasm main.asm main`
- `$ ./main`
- I know, it is so simple.

# LICENSE

- You can obviously use it however you want to,
- BUT, include my name, or i'll come to you.
